ArcGIS Pro files for Delta Smelt and Chinook Salmon populations

The two .csv files in this repository were derived from fish trawl data files obtained from https://filelib.wildlife.ca.gov/Public/Delta%20Smelt/ on 6/27/2023  and https://filelib.wildlife.ca.gov/Public/TownetFallMidwaterTrawl/FMWT%20Data/ on 6/25/2023. Additionally the risk region shape file included was used to create the csv files in the ArcGIS Pro software environment. 

The complete ArcGIS project folders and files are stored on IETC's ToxBox. Contact IETC if further spatial data is needed.
